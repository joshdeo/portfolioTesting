            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h5>Discovery Channel Canada</h5>
            <p>All the content you see on my
                website is from my time at Discovery channel Canada's flagship Science and Technology show 'Daily
                Planet'. I had an internship there as part of a college culminating assignment and was fortunate 
                enough to be offered a job a few months later. The show first aired in 1995 and I started working there 
                straight out of college, from October 2016 until the show ended in May 2018. I began as a 
                researcher and slowly worked my way up to producing mini pieces and then chase producing which was
                an absolute thrill.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time I was chase producing I had learned a lot about journalism. The job was nonstop, which I
                loved. I would get into the office by 8 a.m and sometimes work a full 12 hour day - but it was
                worth every minute. It went from office work to waking up at 3 a.m for an interview with a crew in
                Finland. I couldn't even begin to explain what a language barrier at three in the morning sounds like. But I still
                managed to get into the office and edit it later that morning.
                
            </p>
            <h5>Apple</h5>
            <p>In August 2018 I started
                my job at Apple. It's an incredible place to work; you meet great people, both staff and customers.
                You not only learn about yourself, you acquire important people skills. The retail space is such a
                fast paced environment and easy to get lost in the moment with adrenaline. It definitely teaches
                multi-tasking and time management skills. I started in the Product area in sales, then
                moved up to the Genius Bar. Daily Planet was a Science and Technology show, so being around technology
                all day is my forte. Solving the issues that customer's have is a great ordeal, but an even better feeling when
                you know they walked away satisfied. I now am a repair technician based in-store, which is a great job to
                have and I do not take it lightly.</p>

            <h5>Hobbies</h5>
            <p>A massive part of my life is Technology. My love for it stems from growing up with most the GameBoy's and
                consoles. After that it was all about having the latest iPhone. I am
                currently a self-taught web developer. I enjoy learning new technologies everyday and more about
                computers, phones and how others are implementing it to help better the world. These technologies
                include the same primary three I used to develop this website - HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.</p>
